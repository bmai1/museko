## Usage
This tool requires too much memory to be hosted online using free services.

## Instructions

1. Download `museko.zip` in [Releases](https://github.com/bmai1/museko/releases) and unzip.
3. Install Python dependencies. `essentia-tensorflow` may require `tensorflow` to be installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
```bash
cd path/to/museko
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
```
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run Flask development server, which defaults to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and can be viewed in a web browser.
```
flask run
```

4. Upload mp3 files that you wish to analyze. After a few seconds, it will display the genre prediction graph and audio visualizer.

5. ```Ctrl-C``` in the command line to close the server when you are done.
