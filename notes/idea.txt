Goals:
- Download songs from streaming services such as YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud via youtube-dl + other open-source
- BPM/Key Detection similar to TuneBat
- Genre Prediction using Python audio libraries and open-source TensorFlow models
- Train personal model on small dataset for binary classification of Drum n Bass
- Simple UI with Python Framework
- Draggable divs

Reach/Todo:
- Song Title Detection -> Artist, Album, Date Published

- Style classification with Essentia
- Breakbeat binary classification (Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow)
- Key and BPM (librosa)
- Web app (Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS)
- Bare-bones GUI (Tkinter)
