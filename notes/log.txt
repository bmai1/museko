- Music analysis app using Essentia TensorFlow models to classify songs

Goals:
- Download songs from streaming services such as YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud via youtube-dl + other open-source
- BPM/Key Detection similar to TuneBat
- Genre Prediction using Python audio libraries and open-source TensorFlow models
- Train personal model on small dataset for binary classification of Drum n Bass

Todo:
    - Style classification with Essentia
    - Breakbeat binary classification (Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow)
    - Key and BPM (librosa)
    - Web app (Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS)
    - Bare-bones GUI (Tkinter)

Let's migrate to a desktop app!
    - Tauri (Rust) + React (TypeScript) + Vite (build tool) + shadcn components (?) + museko Python script as subprocesses

TODO:
    - Implement Mulette
        - Discogs/music database API
        - Randomly draw from input genre
        - Album, year released, track length, artist, genre plot
    - Custom audio-visualizer in python/rust/javascript
    - Extract tensorflow values and create a custom plot (matplotlib placeholder)
